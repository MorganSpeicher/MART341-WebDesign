The part of my website that I am most proud of is the checklist page! I really love the pink tones and I think it's a fun way to put my ideas across. It brings a little interactivity to the site which I think is really cool! I think that customizing simple features such as tables can bring a lot more life to a page, and it makes it feel less empty.
Things are going well for me right now! I am starting to feel the mid-semester burnout and am super ready for spring break. I am loving the sunshine though and it's making the seasonal depression go away! Overall, loving this class and having a great time! Thanks for your hard work!
