1. How did the peer review go for the discussion? Was it easier to remember to post and reply with this format? Can I help out with anything specific?:

I actually really liked the peer review. The best part about it was the ability to see what my other classmates are working on. I feel like seeing other peoples work not only provides inspiration but also seeing how others approach the assignment, and to learn from what they create. By the time I'm submitting this I have yet to receive feedback on my post. However, feedback from your peers is incredibly helpful. I had a class last semester where we all gave each other feedback on our iterations up until the final. It really helped open the door to improvement that I would not have tried otherwise. I never had an issue with posting and replying, but this was a nice spin on the discussion.
I've taken a good number of online classes, and most of them have felt very "the canvas shell and me". I find that doing activities like discussions, but more importantly peer reviews and opportunities to just see your classmates' work has created the connection and interaction that I really want. It makes the online class feel way more connected. The professors that take the time to set things up like that are awesome! They make the class feel like it's more than the canvas shell.
I don't need any help right now!
