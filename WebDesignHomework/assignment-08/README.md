Div - I used the div technique to style blocks on content on my site, such as my gallery images. Those blocks include center justifying text and justifying that text under each image. This helped add captions to my images and organize them better on the page.

Span - I used span to change the color of specific sentences on my media site. This added a little vidual interest than just plain black text.

Audio - I used an audio elememnt to add music on my checklist page, this adds another level of interactivity to the site.

Video - I added a copy of my video in the iframe just in case the iframe was not working properly. This added redundancy and accessability to the page.

Iframe - I added a cooking video that I had created as a form of blog content. It brings more varying content to the site while staying within the theme.

Class - I used class to create certain styles that I could refernece using the div element. This made replication of styling elemetns much easier and the code cleaner. I included classes such as justification, color, and image stylization such a size.

Escape character - I used an escape character to take a fun spin on a little quote "Vibes are >(better than/greater than) no vibes. This brings a little life to the site with playful nature.
