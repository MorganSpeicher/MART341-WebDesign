Required Techniques (Must Have):
<br>
At Least 4 Pages – Your website should contain a minimum of four distinct pages that align with a cohesive theme. - Done! Added four pages that correspond to the different things that my website has to offer. I did this through the link and nav element, putting them at the top of my body.


<br>


Responsive Design – Ensure the website layout adjusts smoothly across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile). - Done! I made sure to use percentages, margins, padding, max-width, auto margins, and em's to make the elements of the page adjust as it is sized.


<br>


Media Queries – Use CSS media queries to make design adjustments at specific screen widths for optimal user experience on all devices. - Done! Although my site didn't really require any specific media queries, I added one to make sure that the background color of the site stayed consistent when the window was sized down.


<br>


Navigation Menu – Include a clear, user-friendly navigation menu to allow visitors to easily access each page of the site. - Done! Created a fun navigation menu that corresponded to the different MTG card type colors, I also added a drop down menu to split the kind of products offered into specific sections. I did this by using the hover, display, nav, and a elements.


<br>


Dropdown Menu – Add a dropdown menu within the navigation for sub-pages or sections, if applicable. - Done! I added a drop down menu under the product section of the page to separate the two kinds of product that the site was offering. This separation helped to organize the product and ease user experience. I did this by using the hover, display, and margin elements to create and style the dropdown menu.
