<h1>Why I Chose These Website Ideas</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Personal Portfolio</h2>
<p>
    I have always wanted to build my own personal portfolio webiste for employers to visit that 
    is not hosted on an external site. It would look cleaner and would give me room for creative 
    exploration.

<h2>Recipe Blog</h2>
<p>
    I love to cook and share my allergen free meal ideas with others. It would be cool to record what I
    make and share it with others who have similar dietary restrictions.

<h2>Fake Brand Home Page</h2>
<p>
    I like to create fake brand mockups all the time, it would be interesting to explore what that brands
    website would look like. I feel as though it would help me to think more about conceptualizing brand
    identity.
