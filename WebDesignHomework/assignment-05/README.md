I really enjoyed my networking class ITS150 I took a few years ago. It was being held over at the Missoula College, so I took the bus there, but in a way it was kind of relaxing. I really liked the class because it was really interesting! I learned how to build networks, how IP addresses worked and how to build cables. I also learned how to code routers and switches. There was a huge learning curve, but once I started to understand it was so much fun. I also had Wally Higgins as the professor, and he was really cool.
