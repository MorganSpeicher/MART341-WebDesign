Create a page with an external CSS style sheet - Done!
Add hover effects to enhance interactivity - Done! Added an underline when hovering over the menu selection to help distinguish what the cursor is going to select.

Select at Least Three Additional Techniques:

Use text-decoration to add or remove underlines, lines through text, etc. - Added underlines when hover over menu selection
Align text or elements for a clean layout - used text align center with a id in stylesheet to keep the webiste cohesive and optimize flow.
Try pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes for additional styling effects - Bolded and changed the size of the first letter of every paragraph for emphasis, also added the pseudo class selector to change the color of the main page links after they have been visited. This helps to user distinguish text and helps them to remeber where on the site they have visited.
