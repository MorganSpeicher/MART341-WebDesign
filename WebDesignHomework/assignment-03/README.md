This is a paragraph. The course is going **good** so far. I like the external website, but a few things are confusing. In the canvas shell it sometimes mentions following video tutorials from the external website that aren't there. The semester is going good, just figuring out *scheduling* right now. I'm just excited to work more with HTML! There isn't any support that I need at the moment.
