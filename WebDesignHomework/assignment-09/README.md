# How to Make a Stuffed Animal From Scratch

## Materials Needed:
- Soft fabric of choosing (I recommend fleece)
- Other fabric of choosing for eyes/features or buttons
- Polyfill (For stuffing)
- Paper and pencil/marker (For patterning)
- Scissors
- Sewing machine (optional)
- All purpose cotton thread
- Sewing needle
- Sewing pins (optional - help to keep fabric in place)

## Instructions:

### Step 1: Prepare Materials
Gather all of your materials and pick some fabrics you would like to use for your project. Depending on the size of your
plushie the amount of fabric needed will vary. For a mid-size plushie (roughly the size of your hand) you will need 1/2 yard of fabric. For smaller details only a 1/4 yard is needed.

### Step 2: Prepare Sewing Materials
Gather all of your sewing materials such as scissors, needle and thread, and sewing pins. I recommend color matching your thread to the fabric
to help keep the seams invisible.

### Step 3: Part I: Draft and Cut Out a Pattern
Start by grabbing a few pieces of card stock or paper and tape them together at the sides. Draw out whatever plushie you want to make.
I'm making Cinnamoroll from Sanrio. With my pattern I try to draw the different body parts into sections (head, arm, leg, ear, tail).
For limbs or pieces that have multiples you only need to draw and cut out one. When you draw your pattern onto the fabric you will flip the pieces
over to maintain symmetry. When cutting out the pieces on the fabric leave about a 1/4 inch extra around your pattern to adjust for seam allowance.

### Step 3: Part II: Draft and Cut Out a Pattern
Lay your pattern pieces out onto the wrong side (back side) of your fabric and trace them with a pencil or marker.
making arms they will need a front and back for each one (so four pieces total for two arms, two on one side and two on the other).
After your happy with your pattern cut out the individual pieces using scissors.

### Step 4: Part I: Sew the Pieces Together
Start either hand-sewing or machine-sewing your front and back pieces togther (arm to arm, head to head, etc.) wrong sides together. Use a few sewing pins
to hold the fabric together if the front and back pieces want to seperate while sewing. If hand sewing use a blanket stitch, if machine sewing
go slow and make sure to double back on your stitch at the start and end so it doesn't come apart.
IMPORTANT: Flip the sewed piece right side out and leave one side of your sewed pieces open and then stuff with polyfill. I recommened leaving the top open so it attached easier to the main body.

### Step 4: Part II: Sew the Pieces Together
Once your have your pieces stuffed and flipped right side out start attaching the pieces to the main body with a ladder stitch or invisible
stitch. You can then add on any additional details such as eyes and buttons. I recommened hand stitching this step.

### Step 5: Finishing Touches
Once everything is attached make your finshing touches by cutting off any extra thread and giving it a little love! If you are having trouble
keeping the limbs close to the body you can sew them on with a small invisible stitch to keep them in place.

## Additional Tips
- For a unique touch you can embroider details onto the face with different colored thread.
- Use a soft fabric such as fleece for a warm feel.
- If you are unsure how to make a certain stitch a quick google search can be helpful.
